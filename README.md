## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

🎓 I'm currently a student at **trIOS College**, studying *Web and Development Fundamentals*. I'm just getting started with tools like **GitHub** and will soon be diving into web technologies such as:

- 🌐 **HTML**
- 🎨 **CSS**
- ⚙️ **JavaScript**
- 🧩 *More languages to come...*

Right now, my focus is on learning how to build, version, and manage code like a pro. 💻

## 🎮 My Creative Origins

Before web dev, I came from the world of digital art and animation.

In **2017**, I started studying **Video Game Design and Animation**, where I specialized in creating **textures** and **materials** for:

🎮 Video Games • 📺 TV Shows • 🎬 Films

I’ve used industry tools such as:

- 🖌️ **Substance Painter**
- 🧱 **Substance Designer**
- 🧊 **Maya**
- 🖥️ **3DS Max**

I worked professionally in the animation industry, most notably at **Guru Studio** on the beloved children’s series *Paw Patrol*, developing stylized textures and materials. 🌟

Sadly, I was affected by the industry-wide layoffs in **June 2023**, but I’ve taken that moment as an opportunity to grow and pivot into something new — and I’m loving every minute of it.
